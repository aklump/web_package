Initialize the current directory

usage: web_package init [<template>] [--<config filetype>] [--file=<filename>]

Normally the storage file type is defined by the template used, or the default settings.  However you can force a storage file type by including one of the following:
      --json
      --yaml, --yml
      --ini
      --composer

You can also explicitly set the filename of the storage file using the --file=<name>; it must have a valid extension as listed above.  Note that this flag superscedes the filetype flags.

To initialize using a yml storage config with no template (either is the same):

    web_package init --yml
    web_package init --yaml

To initialize with a given filename

    web_package init --file=composer.json
