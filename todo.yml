## Critical

- handle preserve_patch_zero
- handle patch_prefix

## Normal
- remove all create() command methods
- continue with unit tests on the done class
- unit tests for GitProxy
- remove all access classes.
- get rid of the ROOT_PATH usage, it thwarts unit testing.
- handle git_root
- handle push_* processes

- add dynamic vars to knowledge output for hooks.
- convert the info route or delete?

## Phase Two
- convert build,unbuild,dev to dynamic routes that check against a folder name in hooks.
- split classes in /flax/src?
- study up on https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow, can it be incorporated, should it?
- make composer install
