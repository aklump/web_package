- choose template on init


- convert build,unbuild,dev to dynamic routes that check against a folder name in hooks.
- convert the info route or delete?
-
- add dynamic vars to knowledge output for hooks.

## Phase Two
- split classes in /flax/src?
- study up on https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow, can it be incorporated, should it?
- make composer install
- separate info_file and version_file
