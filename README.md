##Summary

A shell script to help the management of files as a package. Supports
name, description and version number. Integrates with .git and uses gitflow methodology to automatically merge and tag.

##Installation
1. Create a symlink to `web_package.sh`, I suggest `bump` and add it to `~/bin` you can then call this script by typing `bump` on the command line as in the examples below.
1. Make sure that `~/bin` is in your PATH variable
2. Consider adding `.web_package` to your global `.git_ignore` file. **Make sure you are using the leading '.'; you do not want to add `web_package` to the ignores.**to 
1. Below you will see three basic examples for usage:
1. For more info see: <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model>
1. For a list of commands, type `bump`.


##About Version Numbers
1. The versioning schema of `major.minor.micro` is used.
2. There is no limit the to value of each part; as an example something like this is theoretically possible `999.999.999`; further the next minor version after `1.9` is not `2.0`, but rather `1.10`.
2. Version numbers may begin with a prefix, demarkated by a '-', an example of a valid version number with prefix is `7.x-1.0`
3. Read more about version numbers here <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning>
4. At this time there is no support for alphanumeric versions (beyond the prefix) such as `1.0-rc1`, `1.0-alpha2`, etc.


##About the .info File
Web Package looks for a file with the .info extension and will use that for storing the meta data about your project.  If none is found, then `web_package.info` will be created.  You may configure the actual filename in the config file e.g. `info_file = some_other_file.info` if these first two options do not work for you.

##Beginning A New Project
1. In this example you see how we being a new project called example, initialize the git repository and start with a version number of 0.1
1. Had you wanted to start with version 1.0, then you would have used `bump major`; and if you had wanted to start with version 0.0.1 you would have used `bump micro`.

<pre>
$ mkdir example
$ cd example
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Library/WebServer/Documents/globalonenessproject/site-dev/public_html/sites/all/modules/contrib/example/.git/
$ bump init
Enter package name: Example Package
Enter package description: An example package showing how to do this.

A new web_package "Example Package" has been created.

$ bump minor
Version bumped:  0.0.0 ---> 0.1
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
[master (root-commit) e604ade] initial commit
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 web_package.info
$
</pre>

##Developing A Project
1. In this example you make your changes to the develop branch (see [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)) and then commit as normal. You could have also done things on feature branches and merged then back into develop.
1. When all your work is done and you're ready for the release then type `bump release`; this is shorthand for `bump minor release`. If you only want a micro release then type `bump micro release`.  Consequently if you want a major release type `bump major release`. 
2. Immediately thereafter (unless you know what you're doing), type `bump done`

<pre>
$ git co -b develop
Switched to a new branch 'develop'
$ touch do
$ touch re
$ touch mi
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'added do re mi'
[develop 7094ae4] added do re mi
 0 files changed
 create mode 100644 do
 create mode 100644 mi
 create mode 100644 re
$ bump release
Version bumped:  0.1.0 ---> 0.2.0
M	web_package.info
Switched to a new branch 'release-0.2.0'
[release-0.2.0 83abd01] Version bumped from  0.1.0 to 0.2.0
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ bump done
Merging into develop...
Switched to branch 'develop'
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 web_package.info |    2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
Continue to master? (y/n) y
Switched to branch 'master'
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 web_package.info |    2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 do
 create mode 100644 mi
 create mode 100644 re
Delete release-0.2.0? (y/n) y
Deleted branch release-0.2.0 (was 83abd01).
</pre>

Now you can list the tags and see that a tag was just created that matches the current version of your package.

<pre>
$ git tag -l
0.2.0
$ bump -i
name = Example Package
description = An example package showing how to do this
version = 0.2.0
$
</pre>

At this point you need to use `git push` as necessary for your remotes.

##Hotfix On Existing Project
An example of a hotfix to the master branch.

1. While on the master branch type `bump hotfix`.
2. Do the work needed.
3. Type `bump done`.

<pre>
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
$ bump hotfix
Version bumped:  0.2.0 ---> 0.2.1
M	web_package.info
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix-0.2.1'
[hotfix-0.2.1 75b936a] Version bumped from  0.2.0 to 0.2.1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ touch fa
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'added fa'
[hotfix-0.2.1 75b936a] added fa
 0 files changed
 create mode 100644 fa
$ bump done
Merging into develop...
Switched to branch 'develop'
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 web_package.info |    2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
Continue to master? (y/n)y
Switched to branch 'master'
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 web_package.info |    2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
Delete hotfix-0.2.1? (y/n)y
Deleted branch hotfix-0.2.1 (was 75b936a).
</pre>

Again, checking that a tag was created...

<pre>
$ git tag -l
0.2.0
0.2.1
$ bump -i
name = Example Package
description = An example package showing how to do this
version = 0.2.1
</pre>

##Configuration
The configuration file is created during `bump init` and is located at `.web_package/config`.  Default contents look like this:

    master = "master"
    develop = "develop"
    git_remote = origin
    create_tags = yes
    push_tags = ask
    push_develop = no
    
The entire `.web_package` directory should not be included in source control.  **To modify the configurations simply edit `.web_package/config` directly.**  Make sure to have spaces surrounding your equal signs as `create_tags=yes` is not the same as `create_tags = yes`.

###master: `(string)`
The name of the branch you consider master.  If you have more than one branch you consider a master then list them all, separated by spaces, e.g. `"master1 master2"` For more insight into this feature, see the [Drupal Modules/Themes section](#drupal) below.

###develop: `(string)`
The name of the branch you consider develop.  If you have more than one branch you consider a develop branch then list them all, separated by spaces, e.g. `"develop1 develop2"`.  **In the case of multiples: Make sure that you list them in the exact order as the master list, as the correlation of master to develop is imperative.**

###remote: `(string)`
The name of the git remote to be used with `git push [git_remote] release-1.0`

###create_tags: `yes` or `no`
If tags should be created during `bump done`

###push_tags: `no`, `ask` or `auto`
If tags should be pushed to `git_remote`.  Set to `auto` and you will not be prompted first.

###push_develop: `no`, `ask` or `auto`
If develop branches should be pushed to `git_remote`.  Set to `auto` and you will not be prompted first.

*Due to the nature of master branches, I have purposly omitted that shortcut feature.  Instead you will need to manually push your master branches.*

###info_file: `(string)`
(Optional) If you have more than one .info file and you need to force Web Package to use the correct one then add this option. The name of the file containing the version info.

##Smaller Projects (No Development Branch)
For some projects or workflows it does not make sense to maintain both a master and a development branch, say for a MediaWiki extension.  In such a case, you might want to set the configuration like this for maximum benefit from Web Package.

    master = "master"
    develop = "master"
    git_remote = origin
    create_tags = yes
    push_tags = auto
    push_develop = auto
    
The benefits of doing this include:

1. You may `bump release` or `bump hotfix` off of the same branch.
2. You don't have to maintain the extra work of a develop branch.
2. You may have your tags and branch auto pushed to origin for rapid deployment.

**This is not advisable for websites, but only for small code packages that you might be hosting, say on GitHub.com**


##[Drupal Modules/Themes](id:drupal)
When I use this with my Drupal modules, the workflow is a bit different.  For starters, there is no master branch.  Actually the master and development branches are one in the same, but we have one branch for each major version of Drupal.  Like this `git br -l`

    * 7.x-1.x
      6.x-1.x
      5.x-1.x
      
Here's how to modify the config file for a Drupal project.  Change the appropriate lines in `.web_config/config` to look like this, assuming that you are maintaining your module for Drupal versions 6-8â€¦

    master = "8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x"
    develop = "8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x"

In summary what you are saying is this: **I have three master branches, which are one in the same with my develop branches.**  This has the benefit of letting you `bump hotfix` and `bump release` off of the same branch.  Your workflow would then resemble this:

<pre>
$ mkdir drupal_module
$ cd drupal_module
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Volumes/Data/Users/aklump/Repos/git/drupal_module/.git/
$ bump init
Enter package name: Drupal Module
Enter package description: Drupal module example

A new web_package "Drupal Module" has been created. Please set the initial version now.

$ bump major
Version bumped:  0.0.0 ---> 1.0
$ bump i
name = Drupal Module
description = Drupal module example
version = 1.0
$ git add .
$ git cim 'initial commit'
[master (root-commit) 7194384] initial import
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 web_package.info
$ git br -m 6.x-1.x
$ git co -b 7.x-1.x
$ git co -b 8.x-1.x
Switched to a new branch '6.x-1.x'
$ git br -l
  6.x-1.x
  7.x-1.x
* 8.x-1.x  
</pre>

At this point the workflow is pretty much the same, although as noted you will be able to choose `bump hotfix` or `bump release` from each major Drupal version branch.  You get to decide which is best.

##Questions
###When should I use 'bump hotfix'?
When you need to make an immediate change to the production state of the project, you will use `bump hotfix`.  A hotfix is unique in that the release number gets bumped _before_ the work is done.

###When should I use 'bump release'?
When you have finished work on the development branch and you want to release it to the production-ready state of the project, you will use `bump release`.  A release is different from a hotfix, in that the version is bumped _after_ the work is done.

###When should I use 'bump major', 'bump minor', or 'bump micro'?
These three commands are unique in that they do not interact with git in any way, they simply modify `web_package.info`.  The choice of which of the three to use is based on the severity of the changes and your versioning mandates.  However, _why_ you would use one of these three can be answered thus: __Any time that you will need to step away from the development branch for an extended period of time, but cannot release the package.__  This way you can be certain that no implementation of your web_package thinks it has the most recent version.  I would argue it's best practice to `bump_micro` at the end of each work session, if you have multiple projects underway.

Another time to `bump micro` is after you push to a staging server, that way you know your staging server is behind your local.  This may or may not make sense for your situation.
