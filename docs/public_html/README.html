<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A shell script to help the management of files as a package through easy version number manipulation. Supports name, description, author and version number. Integrates with .git and uses <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model">gitflow methodology</a> to automatically merge and tag.</p>

<h2>Script Installation</h2>

<p>The web_package scripts need to be installed on your system once to make the tool available.  Don't confuse this with intializing a project which comes later.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.intheloftstudios.com/packages/bash/web_package/download">this package</a> somewhere on your computer, e.g., <code>~/lib/web_package-master</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure that <code>~/bin</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code> variable of BASH.  To verify type <code>echo $PATH</code> in a shell window and look for the path <code>~/bin</code>; <strong>note that it will probably appear as the expanded home directory, not <code>~</code></strong>.</li>
<li><p>Create a symlink to <code>web_package.sh</code> as <code>bump</code> as seen in the following snippet. (In all examples the symlink is called <code>bump</code> but that is not functionally necessary; you may rename as desired.)  For this snippet we're assuming that the package has been saved to <code>~/lib/web_package-master</code></p>

<pre><code>cd ~/bin &amp;&amp; ln -s ~/lib/web_package-master/web_package.sh bump &amp;&amp; bump
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If all went well you should see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>web_package.info not found. Have you created your Web Package yet?
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2>Why Use Web Package?</h2>

<ul>
<li>To simplify using Gitflow.</li>
<li>To incorporate build scripts in package management.</li>
<li>To automate the process of version incrementing a package.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will save you keystrokes if you're used to typing this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add .
$ git cim 'some changes'
$ git checkout -b release-1.1
$ cat version.info
version = 1.0
$ echo version.info &gt; "version = 1.1"
$ git add version.info
$ git cim 'Bumped version to 1.1'
$ git checkout develop
$ git merge --no-ff release-1.1
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff release-1.1
$ git br -d release-1.1
$ git checkout develop
</code></pre>

<p>How would you rather type this, instead from now on...</p>

<pre><code>$ git add .
$ git cim 'some changes'
$ bump release
$ bump done
</code></pre>

<p>If so, Web Package is for you! Read on...</p>

<h2>About Version Numbers</h2>

<ol>
<li>Two versioning schemas may be used <code>(prefix-)major.minor.patch</code> and <code>(prefix-)major.minor(patch_prefix)patch</code>.</li>
<li>There is no limit the to value of each part; as an example something like this is theoretically possible <code>999.999.999</code>.  Important to note: the next minor version after <code>1.9</code> is not <code>2.0</code>, but rather <code>1.10</code>.</li>
<li><code>(prefix-)</code> is a string of any chars ending in a hyphen, e.g. <code>7.x-</code>.</li>
<li><code>(patch_prefix)</code> is a string of one or more non numbers, e.g. <code>-alpha</code>.</li>
<li>Read more about version numbers here <a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a> &amp;&amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning</a></li>
<li>Read more about Drupal version numbers here <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1015226">http://drupal.org/node/1015226</a></li>
<li>To see many version examples type <code>bump test</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Valid Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>1.0</code></li>
<li><code>1.0.1</code></li>
<li><code>7.x-1.0</code></li>
<li><code>7.x-1.0.1</code></li>
<li><code>1.0-rc1</code></li>
<li><code>1.0-alpha1</code></li>
<li><code>7.x-1.0-rc1</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Invalid Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>1</code> (missing minor digit, use <code>1.0</code> instead.)</li>
<li><code>1-rc1</code> (missing minor digit, use <code>1.0-rc1</code> instead.)</li>
<li><code>1.0-alpha</code> (missing patch digit, use <code>1.0-alpha1</code> instead.)</li>
<li><code>1.0-dev</code> (missing patch digit, don't use <code>-dev</code> or add a patch digit.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>About Version Incrementing</h2>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre><code>patch: 0.0.1 --&gt; 0.0.2
minor: 0.0.1 --&gt; 0.1
major: 0.0.1 --&gt; 1.0
</code></pre>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<p>The key difference to notice is that when you <code>bump minor</code> in this schema, it simply drops the patch prefix and the patch values and does <em>not</em> increment the minor value.  Also if you <code>bump major</code> it will carry over the patch_prefix for you automatically and set the patch value to 1.</p>

<pre><code>patch: 8.x-2.0-alpha6 --&gt; 8.x-2.0-alpha7
minor: 8.x-2.0-alpha6 --&gt; 8.x-2.0
major: 8.x-2.0-alpha6 --&gt; 8.x-3.0-alpha1
</code></pre>

<h3>Stepping by > 1, odd or even</h3>

<p>By default, the major, minor and patch step increment is 1.  This can be changed in a <code>local_config</code> file as necessary (either user or project level).</p>

<pre><code>major_step = 1
minor_step = 1
patch_step = 2
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say that two developers are working on the same master branch and they are rolling out rapid hotfixes.  Wouldn't it be nice if developer A only did odd-numbered hotfixes and developer B only did even-numbered hotfixes, so as to not step on each others' toes?  This the idea behind version incrementing with steps > 1.</p>

<p>You can override the default using the <code>local_config</code> and use odd steps by adding the following lines, be sure to include a line break at the end of the line.</p>

<pre><code>patch_step = "odd"
</code></pre>

<p>For even just change the value to <code>"even"</code>.</p>

<p><em>In this example, if you were to add this directive to the <code>config</code> file, that would negate the whole point, since <code>config</code> is checked into the repo.  You need to use the <code>local_config</code>.</em></p>

<h3>Testing A Version Schema</h3>

<ol>
<li>type <code>bump help test</code> for more info</li>
</ol>

<h2>About the <code>.info</code> File</h2>

<p>Web Package looks for a file with the .info extension and will use that for storing the meta data about your project.  This file is one that can be parsed using php's <code>parse_ini_file()</code> function.  If none is found, then <code>web_package.info</code> will be created.  You may configure the actual filename in the config file e.g. <code>info_file = some_other_file.info</code> if these first two options do not work for you. Here is a basic <code>.info</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>name = "Apple"
description = "A red, green or yellow fruit."
homepage = http://www.intheloftstudios.com/packages/jquery/apple
version = 0.0.1
author = Aaron Klump &lt;sourcecode@intheloftstudios.com&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Timesaving hooks: build, unbuild, dev</h2>

<p>There are three commands that are important to know about.  On their own, that is without special implementation, they do nothing.  However they can be configured to help your process out and save time and reduce errors</p>

<h3><code>bump build</code></h3>

<p>Scripts added to <code>.web_package/hooks/build</code> are run.  By design, these scripts should serve the purpose of building the package and making it ready for a release.  Such as create a <code>dist</code> directory and copy over distribution files, etc.  **Of the three, this is the only command that is automatically called by calling <code>bump done</code>.</p>

<h3><code>bump unbuild</code></h3>

<p>Scripts added to <code>.web_package/hooks/unbuild</code> are run.  You may delete files as necessary to reverse the build step.  May not be that useful for most.</p>

<h3><code>bump dev</code></h3>

<p>Scripts added to <code>.web_package/hooks/dev</code> are run.  The intention here is to set up the project to be developed.  I use this to symlink dependencies during development.  These symlinks get reversed in my build scripts.</p>

<h2>Build Scripts</h2>

<p>You may add php or shell scripts to <code>.web_package/hooks/build</code> and they will be run each time the version increments.  You may also trigger a build by calling <code>bump build</code>.</p>

<p>You can also trigger a single file by passing it's filename; you would want to do this if you need to trigger this one script from an external program, while preserving the callback arguments.  Here is an example (this also works for unbuild and dev):</p>

<pre><code>    bump build only_this_script.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Any file ending in <code>.php</code> or <code>.sh</code> found in the build script folder will be called during version bumping.  Refer to the parameter chart below for script arguments:</p>

<p>One example of using a build script, say with a jQuery plugin, is when you want to embed the version string <em>inside</em> the <code>jquery.pluging_name.js</code> file.  In such a case the  <code>.info</code> file strategy doesn't meet your needs.  For such a scenario you would use a build script.</p>

<h3>Callback Arguments</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your script should print/echo details as to what it did; this will be output to the console.</li>
<li>Be sure to use <em>path to root</em> in your scripts when you reference any files in your project.</li>
<li><p>If you need to source another script, e.g. <code>config</code> that sits in your scripts directory, use <code>dir of the script</code>, here's a shell example...  Notice that without the <code>.sh</code> extension, the file will not automatically get called, which is a good way to do a shared config script.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
source "${10}/config"
source "${11}/functions.sh"
...
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>Beginning A New Project</h2>

<ol>
<li>In this example you see how we being a new project called example, initialize the git repository and start with a version number of 0.1</li>
<li><p>Had you wanted to start with version 1.0, then you would have used <code>bump major</code>; and if you had wanted to start with version 0.0.1 you would have used <code>bump patch</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir example
$ cd example
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Library/WebServer/Documents/globalonenessproject/site-dev/public_html/sites/all/modules/contrib/example/.git/
$ bump init
Enter package name: Example Package
Enter package description: An example package showing how to do this.

A new web_package "Example Package" has been created.

$ bump minor
Version bumped:  0.0.0 ---&gt; 0.1
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
[master (root-commit) e604ade] initial commit
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 web_package.info
$
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2>Reversing <code>bump init</code></h2>

<p>By the way--to reverse the action of <code>bump init</code>, simply delete the folder <code>.web_package</code> from the root of your project.  You may or may not want to delete the <code>*.info</code> file from the root of your project.</p>

<h2>What to add to your project's version control</h2>

<ol>
<li>You should include <code>.web_package</code> in version control.  It has a .gitignore file that you can refer to for files that may safely be excluded.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Developing A Project</h2>

<ol>
<li>In this example you make your changes to the develop branch (see <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model">gitflow</a>) and then commit as normal. You could have also done things on feature branches and merged then back into develop.</li>
<li>When all your work is done and you're ready for the release then type <code>bump release</code>; this is shorthand for <code>bump minor release</code>. If you only want a patch release then type <code>bump patch release</code>.  Consequently if you want a major release type <code>bump major release</code>. </li>
<li><p>Immediately thereafter (unless you know what you're doing), type <code>bump done</code></p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b develop
Switched to a new branch 'develop'
$ touch do
$ touch re
$ touch mi
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'added do re mi'
[develop 7094ae4] added do re mi
 0 files changed
 create mode 100644 do
 create mode 100644 mi
 create mode 100644 re
$ bump release

M   web_package.info
Switched to a new branch 'release-0.2.0'
[release-0.2.0 83abd01] Version bumped from  0.1.0 to 0.2.0
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ bump done
Merging into develop...
Switched to branch 'develop'
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

 create mode 100644 re
Delete release-0.2.0? (y/n) y
Deleted branch release-0.2.0 (was 83abd01).
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can list the tags and see that a tag was just created that matches the current version of your package.</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -l
0.2.0
$ bump -i
name = Example Package
description = An example package showing how to do this
version = 0.2.0
$
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you need to use <code>git push</code> as necessary for your remotes.</p>

<h2>Hotfix On Existing Project</h2>

<p>An example of a hotfix to the master branch.</p>

<ol>
<li>While on the master branch type <code>bump hotfix</code>.</li>
<li>Do the work needed.</li>
<li><p>Type <code>bump done</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
$ bump hotfix
Version bumped:  0.2.0 ---&gt; 0.2.1
M   web_package.info
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix-0.2.1'
[hotfix-0.2.1 75b936a] Version bumped from  0.2.0 to 0.2.1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ touch fa
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'added fa'
[hotfix-0.2.1 75b936a] added fa
 0 files changed
 create mode 100644 fa
$ bump done
Merging into develop...

Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 web_package.info |    2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
Delete hotfix-0.2.1? (y/n)y
Deleted branch hotfix-0.2.1 (was 75b936a).
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Again, checking that a tag was created...</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -l
0.2.0
0.2.1
$ bump -i
name = Example Package
description = An example package showing how to do this
version = 0.2.1
</code></pre>

<h2>Merge conflict during <code>bump done</code></h2>

<p>Follow these steps if you experience a merge conflict after typing <code>bump done</code>; they should get you through it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the file with the conflict</li>
<li>Remove all conflicts</li>
<li>Save the file and <code>git add [file]</code></li>
<li>Repeat until all conflicts are resolved</li>
<li>Type <code>git commit</code></li>
<li>Now go back the hotfix or release branch: <code>git checkout hotfix…</code></li>
<li>Re-initiate <code>bump done</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Alpha, Beta and RC</h2>

<p>There are three commands that will move your package through the stages, but only in the logical order.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>bump alpha</code> call this when your version doesn't already contain alpha, beta or rc as the patch prefix.  Example, calling <code>bump alpha</code> on a version of <code>1.0</code> will bump your version to <code>1.1-alpha1</code>.</li>
<li>Calling <code>bump beta</code> on when your project is already in alpha will move it to beta stage, e.g. <code>bump beta</code> when your version is <code>1.1-alpha5</code> moves it to <code>1.1-beta1</code>.</li>
<li>Calling <code>bump rc</code> on a <code>1.1-beta3</code> bumps it to <code>1.1-rc1</code></li>
<li>You can go directly to beta or to rc, but not the other direction, e.g. if your version is <code>2.3</code> you can <code>bump rc</code> and it becomes <code>2.4-rc1</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The configuration file is created during <code>bump init</code> and is located at <code>.web_package/config</code>.  Default contents look like this:</p>

<pre><code>master = "master"
develop = "develop"
git_remote = origin
create_tags = yes
push_tags = ask
push_master = ask
push_develop = ask
</code></pre>

<p>The entire <code>.web_package</code> directory should not be included in source control.  <strong>To modify the configurations simply edit <code>.web_package/config</code> directly.</strong>  Make sure to have spaces surrounding your equal signs as <code>create_tags=yes</code> is not the same as <code>create_tags = yes</code>.  <strong>Also you must have a line break at the end of the file!</strong></p>

<h3>master: <code>(string)</code></h3>

<p>The name of the branch you consider master.  If you have more than one branch you consider a master then list them all, separated by spaces, e.g. <code>"master1 master2"</code> For more insight into this feature, see the <a href="#drupal">Drupal Modules/Themes section</a> below.</p>

<h3>develop: <code>(string)</code></h3>

<p>The name of the branch you consider develop.  If you have more than one branch you consider a develop branch then list them all, separated by spaces, e.g. <code>"develop1 develop2"</code>.  <strong>In the case of multiples: Make sure that you list them in the exact order as the master list, as the correlation of master to develop is imperative.</strong></p>

<h3>remote: <code>(string)</code></h3>

<p>The name of the git remote to be used with <code>git push [git_remote] release-1.0</code></p>

<h3>create_tags: <code>major</code>, <code>minor</code>, <code>patch</code> or <code>no</code></h3>

<p>When executing <code>bump done</code>, determine what severity level will create a git tag.  Set to <code>no</code> to never create a tag.</p>

<h3>push_tags: <code>no</code>, <code>ask</code> or <code>auto</code></h3>

<p>If tags should be pushed to <code>git_remote</code>.  Set to <code>auto</code> and you will not be prompted first.</p>

<h3>push_master: <code>no</code>, <code>ask</code> or <code>auto</code></h3>

<p>If master branches should be pushed to <code>git_remote</code>.  Set to <code>auto</code> and you will not be prompted first.</p>

<h3>push_develop: <code>no</code>, <code>ask</code> or <code>auto</code></h3>

<p>If develop branches should be pushed to <code>git_remote</code>.  Set to <code>auto</code> and you will not be prompted first.</p>

<h3>info_file: <code>(string)</code></h3>

<p>(Optional) If you have more than one .info file and you need to force Web Package to use the correct one then add this option. The name of the file containing the version info.</p>

<h3>author: <code>"(string)"</code></h3>

<p>(Optional) This one needs to be wrapped in quotes if you have spaces like this example… "Aaron Klump \<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;:&#x73;&#111;&#117;&#x72;&#x63;&#101;c&#x6f;&#100;&#101;&#x40;&#x69;&#110;&#116;&#x68;&#x65;&#108;&#x6f;&#x66;&#116;&#115;&#x74;&#x75;&#100;i&#x6f;&#115;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x73;&#111;&#117;&#x72;&#x63;&#101;c&#x6f;&#100;&#101;&#x40;&#x69;&#110;&#116;&#x68;&#x65;&#108;&#x6f;&#x66;&#116;&#115;&#x74;&#x75;&#100;i&#x6f;&#115;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a>".  This will get written to <code>web_package.info</code> file during the init process.</p>

<h3>init_version: <code>"(string)"</code></h3>

<p>(Optional)  This is used during <code>bump init</code> to set the default version of a package.</p>

<h3>patch_prefix: <code>"(string)"</code></h3>

<p>(Optional)  This is used as the default patch_prefix.</p>

<h3>php: <code>"(string)"</code></h3>

<p>(Optional)  The path to the php to use for PHP build scripts.</p>

<h3>bash: <code>"(string)"</code></h3>

<p>(Optional)  The path to bash to use for shell build scripts.</p>

<h3>pause: <code>"(int)"</code></h3>

<p>(Optional)  Enter a number of seconds to pause before git creates a branch and adds files.  This is here in case you need to allow time for file processing after the version file has been updated. If you want to be prompted before git does it's thing enter a -1 here.</p>

<h2>Global Configuration</h2>

<p>A global configuration file may be created at <code>~/.web_package/config</code>, the contents of which will be used as defaults for new projects or existing projects without said parameter.  This is most useful for the <code>author</code> and <code>info_file</code> parameters.  **Note: if a global config parameter is set, but the project does not override it, the global will apply for that project, even after <code>bump init</code>.</p>

<h2>Configuration Templates</h2>

<p>Let's take the use case of a Drupal module, which has a different configuration setup than a website project.  For our module we want the following configuration:</p>

<pre><code>master = 8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x
develop = 8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x
remote = origin
create_tags = patch
push_tags = ask
push_develop = no
push_master = ask
info_file = web_package.info
patch_prefix = -rc
</code></pre>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice to not have to retype that for every new Drupal module?  Well you don't have to if you use a Global Template.</p>

<h3>Defining a Global Template</h3>

<p>For a template called <code>drupal</code>, create a file at <code>~/.web_package/config_drupal</code>, containing the configuration you wish to use for that class of projects.  So the pattern is <code>~/.web_package/config_[template name]</code>.</p>

<h3>Implementing a Global Template</h3>

<p>When creating a new project, use the command <code>bump init drupal</code> and your template will automatically be used as the default configuration.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir new_drupal
$ cd new_drupal
$ bump init drupal
Template drupal used.
Enter package name: Drupal Module
Enter package description: a good one.

A new web_package "Drupal Module" (version: 7.x-1.0-alpha1) has been created.

$ bump config
master = 8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x
develop = 8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x
remote = origin
create_tags = patch
push_tags = ask
push_develop = no
push_master = ask
info_file = web_package.info
patch_prefix = -rc
$
</code></pre>

<h2><a href="id:drupal">Drupal Modules/Themes</a></h2>

<p>When I use this with my Drupal modules, the workflow is a bit different.  For starters, there is no master branch.  Actually the master and development branches are one in the same, but we have one branch for each major version of Drupal.  The tags become really important as the release packages are built from them.  Observe <code>git br -l</code></p>

<pre><code>* 7.x-1.x
  6.x-1.x
  5.x-1.x
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how to modify the config file for a Drupal project.  Change the appropriate lines in <code>.web_config/config</code> to look like this, assuming that you are maintaining your module for Drupal versions 6-8…</p>

<pre><code>master = "8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x"
develop = "8.x-1.x 7.x-1.x 6.x-1.x"
create_tags = yes
push_tags = ask    
</code></pre>

<p>In summary what you are saying is this: <strong>I have three master branches, which are one in the same with my develop branches.</strong>  This has the benefit of letting you <code>bump hotfix</code> and <code>bump release</code> off of the same branch.  Your workflow would then resemble this:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir drupal_module
$ cd drupal_module
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Volumes/Data/Users/aklump/Repos/git/drupal_module/.git/
$ bump init
Enter package name: Drupal Module
Enter package description: Drupal module example

A new web_package "Drupal Module" has been created. Please set the initial version now.

$ bump major
Version bumped:  0.0.0 ---&gt; 1.0
$ bump i
name = Drupal Module
description = Drupal module example
version = 1.0
$ git add .
$ git cim 'initial commit'
[master (root-commit) 7194384] initial import
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 web_package.info
$ git br -m 6.x-1.x
$ git checkout -b 7.x-1.x
$ git checkout -b 8.x-1.x
Switched to a new branch '6.x-1.x'
$ git br -l
  6.x-1.x
  7.x-1.x
* 8.x-1.x  
</code></pre>

<p>At this point the workflow is pretty much the same, although as noted you will be able to choose <code>bump hotfix</code> or <code>bump release</code> from each major Drupal version branch.  You get to decide which is best.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3>When should I use 'bump hotfix'?</h3>

<p>When you need to make an immediate change to the production state (master branch) of the project, you will use <code>bump hotfix</code>.  A hotfix is unique in that the release number gets bumped <em>before</em> the work is done.</p>

<h3>When should I use 'bump release'?</h3>

<p>When you have finished work on the development branch and you want to release it to the production-ready state of the project, you will use <code>bump release</code>.  A release is different from a hotfix, in that the version is bumped <em>after</em> the work is done.</p>

<h3>When should I use 'bump major', 'bump minor', or 'bump patch'?</h3>

<p>These three commands are unique in that they do not interact with git in any way, they simply modify <code>web_package.info</code>.  The choice of which of the three to use is based on the severity of the changes and your versioning mandates.  However, <em>why</em> you would use one of these three can be answered thus: <strong>Any time that you will need to step away from the development branch for an extended period of time, but cannot release the package.</strong>  This way you can be certain that no implementation of your web_package thinks it has the most recent version.  I would argue it's best practice to <code>bump_patch</code> at the end of each work session, if you have multiple projects underway.</p>
